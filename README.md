# Widgets
This repository made for a university project, used C++11 and a graphic library made by our lecturer.
(Hungarian) Documentation of the used graphic library: http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~flugi/grafikuslib/graphics.html

Throughout the semester we had to create and design a set of widgets from scratch (such as Button, Listcontrol, Textcontrol, Numericcontrol, Checkbox, Static Text, etc.) and use them as the base of the three projects and the final exams.
The third project's repository: https://github.com/gyurinagy/ConnectFour

An application class is included, which contains the widgets and the main class runs the application.
